Boston Housing

Overview:
This repository contains an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project on the Boston Housing Dataset. The goal is to explore the dataset, perform data preparation, and build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts.

Dataset Description
The Boston Housing Dataset is a classic dataset with features related to housing properties in various neighborhoods.
It includes 506 samples and 13 feature variables.
The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Key steps include:
Loading the dataset.
Understanding feature distributions.
Investigating correlations.
Visualizing relationships between features and target.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model:

The model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process are documented.
Evaluation metrics (e.g., Root Mean Square Error) are reported
